#### Webpack
Why does webpack exist? Webpack, at its core, is a code bundler. It takes your code, transforms and bundles it, then returns a brand new version of your code.

What problem is this thing solving? Think about how many times we have to take our code and change it so it's compliant with what the browser is used to (vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). If you've ever used a CSS Preprocessor like SASS or LESS you know you need to transform your SASS/LESS code into normal CSS. If you've ever used CoffeeScript or any compile to JavaScript language you know there's also a conversion step there. So where Webpack really shines is you're able to tell it every transformation your code needs to make, and it will do them and output a bundle file for you full of those changes (and some other helpful things as well like minification if you desire).
